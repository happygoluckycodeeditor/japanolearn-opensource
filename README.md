# japanolearn-opensource

Japanolearn-Opensource is an open-source Japanese learning Application which is made with a goal of acccessibility to learn Japanese in Mind. The software is free and the source code is available for anyone to see and critique.

The app is work in progress and it will take some time for the app's V0.5 Alpha to come up. We are thinking of releasing it by the end of February 2025!

## Current Progress Status

As of April 13, we have been getting difficulties in figuring out how to build the app. I was doing experiments on it and I was not able to make a stable build which can be a problem later on at the end of the month.
I am trying to figure out how to add the Dictionary SQL Lite file to the resources of the build and also fix the UI issues of the application. Let's see how it works out.
We are still on track but errors can delay the launch of the initial application. Let's see How it turns to be.
From Mid of April I will be starting to work on the demo video content of the application and see how that turns out to be.

From Mid April I will be adding some lessons and videos which will be usef for the application. The videos will be uploaded on youtube! So please look forward.

##Features

The program has the following features

###Lessons

The application has a lesson feature where different aspects of the Japanese Language (Grammar, reading, learing Hiragana, etc) are incorporated into bite-size lessons

###Exercises

The exercise section has lots of exercises which are based on lessons, these can range from Kanji quizzes, grammar practice and also reading and comprehension practice.

###Dictionary

The Dictionary has a interactive easy to search dictionary which can be used for searching words when you feel like it!
(This is quasi finished)

### ‼️Just a Disclaimer that the application is not perfect and it has been my first app, I will continuously try to improve on it‼️ 

### No Warranty is covered with this application

## Recommended IDE Setup

The Japanolearn app is made through Electron and is run with Typecript and Javascript and therefore having some experience with Javascript and React will definitely help with working on the Japanolearn's Application development.
